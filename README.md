Organised criminal gangs responsible for large fly-tipping incidents.

In February 2020 the BBC Shared Data Unit reported that organised criminal gangs were being blamed for the continued rise of large fly-tipping incidents across England.

We compared official statistics on flytipping over several years, analysing the scale and cost of major fly-tipping incidents across England.

This found:

Our analysis found the number of incidents of large-scale fly-tipping has more than doubled since 2012.
Police and environmental groups say the nature of fly-tipping is changing - a shift driven by a surge in criminal gangs offering illegal waste clearing services.
Since the 2012-13 financial year, councils in England have spent just over £59 million clearing large scale tips. The bill for such incidents was at its highest in 2018-19.
Tipper lorry loads accounted for just over 125,000 of the total number of major incidents, while “significant/multi-loads” were recorded for just under 67,000 major incidents.

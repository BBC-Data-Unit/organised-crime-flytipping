# Fly-tipping: Organised crime behind large rise

In February 2020 the BBC Shared Data Unit [reported](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-50660138) that organised criminal gangs were being blamed for the continued rise of large fly-tipping incidents across England.

We compared official statistics on flytipping over several years, analysing the scale and cost of major fly-tipping incidents across England.

Our analysis found:

- The number of incidents of large-scale fly-tipping had more than doubled since 2012.
- Police and environmental groups said the nature of fly-tipping was changing - a shift driven by a surge in criminal gangs offering illegal waste clearing services.
- Since the 2012-13 financial year, councils in England had spent just over £59m clearing large scale tips. The bill for such incidents was at its highest in 2018-19.
- Tipper lorry loads accounted for just over 125,000 of the total number of major incidents, while “significant/multi-loads” were recorded for just under 67,000 major incidents.
